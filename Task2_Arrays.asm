    ; Step 1: Swap elements at r12 (left index) and r13 (right index)

    mov [array + r13], al    ; Store the value from the left index (al) in the right index (r13)

    ; Step 3: Move the indices towards each other (left index increases, right index decreases)
    inc r12                  ; Increment the left index (r12) to move towards the center of the array
    dec r13                  ; Decrement the right index (r13) to move towards the center of the array

    ; Step 4: Repeat the loop until left index is greater than or equal to right index
    jmp reverse_loop         ; Continue the loop to reverse the next pair of elements

    ; Challenge with memory handling during reversal:
    ; - I need to be extra careful when accessing array elements via their memory addresses.
    ; - Directly referencing memory with indices could easily lead to errors, especially when accessing out-of-bounds memory.
    ;   For example, if the indices for the left and right elements are not managed properly, I could accidentally overwrite the memory
    ;   or cause undefined behavior by accessing the wrong parts of memory.
    ; - The assembly doesn't provide automatic bounds checking, so I have to manage the array size manually to avoid issues.
    ; - Swapping the elements requires careful memory management, making sure I store values in the correct places without
    ;   unintentionally corrupting any memory.

    xor rdi, rdi           ; Exit status code 0 (successful)

    mov rsi, invalid_input_msg
    mov rdx, invalid_input_len
    syscall

    ; Restart the input loop after invalid input
    jmp input_loop

    ; Challenge with invalid input handling:
    ; - The direct handling of input memory requires careful checking to make sure it's valid.
    ; - Any incorrect assumption about memory or buffer sizes (e.g., assuming there's no newline or extra characters) could
    ;   cause issues with reading or writing data in the wrong place.
    ; - When dealing with raw memory, there are no automatic safety checks, so careful bounds checking and validation are needed.
